mplayer-configuration
=====================

Configuration file for mplayer

As I don't know how to use GIT, cloning the repository makes a directory mplayer-configuration. Thus the config file needs to be copied from the mplayer-configuration directory to ~/.mplayer/ directory.

Time to learn how to use GIT. Should't be too hard.
